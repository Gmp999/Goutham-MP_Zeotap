# Real-Time Data Processing for Weather

This project is a web-based application for monitoring real-time weather data, alerts, and daily summaries for predefined cities. It uses a backend to fetch weather information and displays it in a user-friendly format on the frontend.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Updates:** Displays current weather information including main weather conditions, temperature, and feels-like temperature for multiple cities. Data is refreshed every 5 minutes.
- **Weather Alerts:** Shows any weather alerts related to the cities.
- **Daily Weather Summary:** Provides a summary of weather conditions, including average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as dominant conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Stylesheet:** Custom CSS
- **Data Source:** Real-time weather data fetched from an API

## File Structure

- **app.py:** The backend script that handles requests and fetches weather data. It provides endpoints for weather data, alerts, and daily summaries.
- **app1.js:** The main JavaScript file responsible for fetching weather data from the backend and updating the UI.
- **style1.css:** The CSS file that defines the styling for the web page.
